    <p>Captain’s Log — <span id="stardate">2077-05-07</span></p>
    <p>I've just received my mission from King Kiertha himself. It's not what I was hoping for, but duty calls. I've been tasked with escorting Princess Yonnae to a hidden colony on Earth in the Appalachian Mountains. It's a long journey, and I can't say I'm excited about it, but the safety of the heir to the throne is of utmost importance, and I understand my role in ensuring that safety.</p>
    <p>Even if I would rather be on the frontlines. Even if I believe my ship and her crew are being wasted. If the king believes a Mothership is necessary for transporting his daughter, who am I to argue?</p>
    <p>It's been months since I've been on a transport mission, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'm confident in my abilities as a captain and as a Thatan warrior. The Stone Butch is one of the most advanced ships in our fleet, and I trust her completely. We'll make the journey safely, and I'll make sure Princess Yonnae is well-protected.</p>
    <p>I can't help but feel a sense of unease, though. We're at war with the Zetan Empire, and every moment away from the front lines is a moment lost. I know my duty, and I'll carry it out to the best of my abilities. I'll use this time to rest, to meditate, and to prepare myself for whatever may come.</p>
    <p>Captain Conna Therikin, signing off.</p>

    <p>I can't believe this is happening. My father is sending me away to Earth to hide from the Zetan empire. I've never felt so angry and helpless before. I don't want to leave my home, my people, and my friends behind. But I know I have to do this. My father said it's for my own safety and the safety of our people.</p>
    <p>I'm supposed to be excited about this new adventure, but all I can think of is how unfair this is. Why do we have to hide? Why can't we fight back against the Zetans? I know the answer, but I still can't help but feel angry and frustrated.</p>
    <p>At least I have my girlfriend, Erya, with me. She's the only thing that's keeping me sane right now. She's so calm and understanding. I'm lucky to have her by my side. We're traveling in a small starship to the secret Thatan colony on Earth, located in the Appalachian Mountains. I don't know what to expect, but I hope it's not too different from home.</p>
    <p>I'm scared, but I won't let fear control me. I have to be strong for my people, for my family, and for Erya. I'll make the best of this situation and try to find some happiness in this new place.</p>

    <p>We've finally arrived in the Sol system, and we're making our way towards Earth. It's been a long and difficult journey, with several major incidents occurring along the way (Thank the gods for my engineers’ skill with field repairs. Hopefully the life support system remains working until we return home.). Thankfully, Princess Yonnae was never made aware of any issues. She's been a model passenger, staying out of the way and never complaining, even though the journey has been long and grueling.</p>
    <p>I hear she sequestered herself in the bio-lab for the majority of the trip. She claims to be learning, but it’s clear from her experiments she’s an expert. Impressive for someone of her age without any secondary education. This must be the difference Royal Tudors make.</p>
    <p>I decided to give her a view of Earth from the bridge this afternoon. It's always been one of my favorite sights, and I thought she might enjoy it too. She certainly did. I can still remember her eyes sparkling in wonder at the sight of the blue and green planet below us.</p>
    <p>Earth is a special planet, even for a Class-M. Its continents are like an ink blot test. You can see yourself in them. It makes you feel at home. I’ve always wondered what Earthlings will think of other worlds once they are starfaring. </p>
    <p>I can't help but feel a sense of foreboding. Earth is a dangerous place, especially for someone like Princess Yonnae. We've received reports of Zetan activity in the area, and I know we'll have to be extra vigilant during our stay here. Even worse, there is tension between Earth’s nations. Enough where they believe a war is imminent.</p>
    <p>As kind as our Earthling allies are, I would hesitate to trust my own daughter’s safety to savages who still war amongst themselves. Thankfully, the colony is deep within a rural zone of no strategic importance. She will be safe.</p>
    <p>But for now, I'll enjoy this moment of peace and beauty. It's rare in our line of work, and I want to savor it while it lasts. The Earth looks so fragile and delicate from up here, but I know it's a strong and resilient planet, filled with brave and determined people. I hope we can count on their help if we need it.</p>

  <p>Oh my stars! I can hardly believe it, but we've finally arrived in the Sol system, and I've just seen Earth for the first time with my own eyes. It's beautiful! The swirls of blue and green remind me of a beautiful gemstone that I once saw in the royal treasury. I can hardly wait to explore all that this new world has to offer.</span></p>
  <p>The journey here was long and hard, but I found ways to keep myself entertained. I spent much of my time in the ship's science lab, learning about bio-engineering and other fascinating subjects. The crew has been so kind to me, but I can't help feeling a little homesick. I miss my family and my friends. Especially Erya. She's gotten extra distant. I think she only just now realized what going with me means for her.</span></p>
  <p>As we get closer to Earth, I can't help feeling a little nervous. I'm not sure how the people of this planet will react to me or to the fact that I'm a lesbian. Back on Thata, our people were always accepting and loving, but I've heard that Earth has a long way to go when it comes to equality and acceptance.</span></p>
  <p>I don't even know if I'll get to interact with many Earthlings. I heard I'll have to talk to their PResident, which is some kind of democratic leader. I hope I wont be too uncomfortable. I heard Earthlings are bald apes. That sounds pretty gross. All that muscle, long arms, and hunched posture? I hope that dosn't come across as racist. I just mean it sounds like they look very… Unaesthetic. Earthlings are wonderful people. They've given us a safe haven on their planet for 130 of their years. That's more than six of their generations!</span></p>
  <p>Poor short lived dears. Maybe we can sell them some cosmetics? I know we give them some technology sometimes.</span></p>
  <p>Despite my fears, I'm determined to make the best of this new opportunity. I'll miss my home and my people, but I'm excited to see what the future holds. I can't wait to explore the beautiful planet that is now my new home. I just hope that I can make a difference here and help my people to survive and thrive.</span></p>
