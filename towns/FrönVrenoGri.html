<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Frön Vreno Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1449, by Ga̋ń̄r Ca̋nvé̄y 'Sugar Aura' Cú̄kī Hä̌ Mb̪f̄kī̌. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ga̋ń̄r Ca̋nvé̄y 'Sugar Aura' Cú̄kī Hä̌ Mb̪f̄kī̌.</p>
<p>Frön Vreno Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Frön Vreno Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Frön Vreno Gri is is constructed  arround a series of broad gravel mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Frön Vreno Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Frön Vreno Gri's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Frön Vreno Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Frön Vreno Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Frön Vreno Gri's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
